one time emergency passwords
if you do not have access to your two factor authentication device you can use any of the following passwords instead of a regular security code. each one of these emergency passwords is immediately destroyed upon use. we recommend printing these passwords out and keeping the printout in a safe and accessible location , e.g. your wallet or a safety deposit box .
there are currently no emergency one time passwords generated in your account. the passwords will be generated automatically and displayed here as soon as you activate two factor authentication .
