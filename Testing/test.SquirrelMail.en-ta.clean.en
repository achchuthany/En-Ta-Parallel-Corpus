you should be aware that the encryption used to store your password is not perfectly secure. however , if you are using pop , there is inherently no encryption anyway. additionally , the encryption that we do to save it on the server can be undone by a hacker reading the source to this file .
if you leave password empty , it will be required when you fetch mail .

select &lt; b &gt; enable media playing &lt; / b &gt; to turn on playing a media file when unseen mail is in your folders. when enabled , you can specify the media file to play in the provided file box .
the &lt; b &gt; check all boxes , not just inbox &lt; / b &gt; option will check all of your folders for unseen mail , not just the inbox for notification .
selecting the &lt; b &gt; show popup &lt; / b &gt; option will enable the showing of a popup window when unseen mail is in your folders ( requires javascript ) .
use the &lt; b &gt; check recent &lt; / b &gt; to only check for messages that are recent. recent messages are those that have just recently showed up and have not been \ viewed \ or checked yet. this can prevent being continuously annoyed by sounds or popups for unseen mail .
selecting the &lt; b &gt; change title &lt; / b &gt; option will change the title in some browsers to let you know when you have new mail ( requires javascript , and only works in ie but you won &apos;t see errors with other browsers ) . this will always tell you if you have new mail , even if you have &lt; b &gt; check recent &lt; / b &gt; enabled .
select from the list of &lt; b &gt; server files &lt; / b &gt; the media file to play when new mail arrives. selecting &lt; b &gt; local media &lt; / b &gt; will play the file specified in the &lt; b &gt; local media file &lt; / b &gt; box to play from the local computer. if no file is specified , the system will use a default from the server .
enable media playing
check all boxes , not just inbox
count only messages that are recent
